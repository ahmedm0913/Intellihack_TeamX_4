# Stock Price Prediction System  
**Team Name**: TeamX 
**Competition**: Intel1i Hack  

---

## Project Overview  
This repository contains our solution for the Intel1i Hack competition. We developed a machine learning model to predict stock prices 5 days into the future and designed an end-to-end system architecture for deployment.

## How to Reproduce Results  
1. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn lightgbm jupyter
2. Run the Notebooks
Step 1: Open notebooks/Stock_EDA.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to perform exploratory data analysis.

Step 2: Open notebooks/Model_Training.ipynb to train the model and generate predictions.

3. Outputs
Predictions: Saved in predictions/predictions.csv.

System Design: See system_design.png (diagram) and system_design.txt (explanations).
